# Python Beginner Game

This is a simple text-based adventure game created as part of my learning journey with Python. The game allows players to make choices that lead to different outcomes, demonstrating basic programming concepts such as user input, conditionals, and string manipulation.

## Features
- User inputs their name to personalize the game.
- Players make decisions that affect the outcome of the story.
- Basic Python concepts such as conditionals, loops, and string handling are implemented.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

## How to Play
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
3. Run the `game.py` file using the command:  
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to make decisions and play the game!
   ```bash
   python game.py

## Project Goals
This project helped me practice:

Using conditionals (if, elif, else) for decision-making.

Handling user input and providing output based on choices.

Writing a simple interactive program in Python.
